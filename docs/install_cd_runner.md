cops_gci_runner_config:
  runners:
    - name: "zzz.foo.net"
      executor: "shell"
      tag_list: ["{{ansible_fqdn}}"]

```

## example pillar with configuring a runner for SSH executor
```yaml
cops_gci_register_token: "xxx"
cops_gci_url: "https://gitlab.foo.net"
cops_gci_runner_config:
  runners:
    - name: "{{ansible_fqdn}} (CI)"
      executor: "ssh"
      tag_list: ["{{ansible_fqdn}}"]
      ssh_user: "root"
